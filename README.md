## What I Do 🎯

I craft clean, performant frontends that users actually love to interact with. My playground is **React** and **TypeScript**, my canvas is **Tailwind CSS**, and my mission is to make the web feel less clunky and more human.

### Currently Working On:
- 🎨 Designing seamless user experiences
- ⚡ Optimizing performance and bundle sizes
- 🔧 Building scalable component architectures
- 🚀 Exploring the latest in React ecosystem
